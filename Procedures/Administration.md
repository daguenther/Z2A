When it comes to managing computers from an administration standpoint, there are a number of different tools and procedures to use.

# Google Apps for Education

Google apps for education is the easiest approach to going from zero to awesome overnight. Outsourcing the server demands means that as a small school, one does not need to worry about server strain. The downside is that if Google ever does go offline, there is nothing you can do about it.

I would recommend this approach for new schools, but not for large scale schools that have the money to have an IT department. The reason rests on a belief that important information, such as student work and internal communication, should happen locally rather then globally.

# Bring your own device (BYOD)

It is a emormous task to try and manage everyone's computer. To cut down on strain, as well as IT cost, it is more feasible to try a BYOD approach. While this does mean that students are encouraged to bring their own device, a certain set of precautions must be in place

1. The student must bring a device with an operating system accepted by the school
2. The student must have installed all the apps the school recommends for learning in their particular area

# Technology Use

Certain guidelines and proceduers must be in place for proper computer use.

Problem: students are left to exercise their flesh nature over the internet without regulation.
