When it comes to managing computers from an administration standpoint, there are a number of different tools to use.

# Google Apps for Education

Google apps for education is the easiest approach to going from zero to awesome overnight. Outsourcing the server demands means that as a small school, one does not need to worry about server strain. The downside is that if Google ever does go offline, there is nothing you can do about it.

I would recommend this approach for new schools, but not for large scale schools that have the money to have an IT department
