When it comes to managing computers from an administration standpoint, there are a number of different tools and procedures to use.

# Google Apps for Education

Google apps for education is the easiest approach to going from zero to awesome overnight. Outsourcing the server demands means that as a small school, one does not need to worry about server strain. The downside is that if Google ever does go offline, there is nothing you can do about it.

I would recommend this approach for new schools, but not for large scale schools that have the money to have an IT department. The reason rests on a belief that important information, such as student work and internal communication, should happen locally rather then globally.

# Bring your own device (BYOD)

It is a emormous task to try and manage everyone's computer. To cut down on strain, as well as IT cost, it is more feasible to try a BYOD approach. While this does mean that students are encouraged to bring their own device, a certain set of precautions must be in place

1. The student must bring a device with an operating system accepted by the school
2. The student must have installed all the apps the school recommends for learning in their particular area

# Technology Use

Certain guidelines and proceduers must be in place for proper computer use. Communication must also happen with parents for the use of these guidlines at home.

* Don't pretend to be someone who you're not
* If you wouldn't say it in person, don't say it online
* Don't steal other people's stuff, it's against the law
* Don't hack programs unless you're allowed to
* It's better to say something in person if you can
* Don't sit in one place for too long, it's bad for you
* Don't torrent or download large files during the day
* Don't share personal information with people you don't know

Additional discussion will be with only parents. At the beginning of each school year a workshop / presentation will be held for 

* Screen time
* People kids meet online
* Exposure to violence, language, pornography

# Cyber Bulling

The school will set up a email address for the submission of cyber bulling attacks. The email address will be made publically available for students to access. Students are asked to include the following information:

1. Full Name (real name and cyber name)
2. Name of attacker (real name and cyber name)
3. Location of attack (which social network)
4. Quoted exert of attack

Upon receiving an email, an emailed will be forward to the parents / guardian in charge of the student (unless the attack comes from home).

The school will then procede to find the attacker and establish the following disciplinary action. Collaboration will be done with parents to reccomend how to approach the situation at home.

* 1st offence: Apologize in person / 1 week without internet devices at school (at home with parents consent)
* 2nd offence: Apologize in person with both parents present / 2 weeks without devices
* 3rd offence: Apologize in front of school / 3 weeks without devices
* 4th offence: Permanent Suspention

The school will also provide help for the victim.

* Counselling (as need be)
* Going socially offline (as need be)
