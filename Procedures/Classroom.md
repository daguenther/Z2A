Below are some procedures for using various forms of technology in the classroom

# Youtube

* Load video before showing
* Have it ready to start (without ads)
* Remove annotations, unless the video is enhanced by them (go to youtube settings, playback, and uncheck annotations)

# Word Processing

* Provide a consistent theme for presenting documents (don't change your handout style mid-semester)
* Provide PDF documents for digital form
