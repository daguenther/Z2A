Below are some procedures for using various forms of technology in the classroom

# Youtube

* Load video before showing
* Have it ready to start (without ads)
* Remove annotations, unless the video is enhanced by them (go to youtube settings, playback, and uncheck annotations)

# Word Processing

* Provide a consistent theme for presenting documents (don't change your handout style mid-semester)
* Provide PDF documents for digital form

# Digital Submissions

* Provide easy to access submission folder
* Make sure students submissions are stored in more then one location
* Students must not be able to see other's submissions if they choose not to

##Possible solutions:
* Have a Bittorent Sync client installed on all machines: students can simply put their assignments in it and have it synced to you
*  Use a dedicated email address on your server. (ex: david.guenther.assignments@yourhost.com)
* Use your school email, but have a labelling system that marks all student messages into another folder
* Use a LMS, like Google Classroom or Moodle which supports online submissions
