# Getting Started

## Website (I4)
1. Buy Hardware

I highly recommend [Dell's Tower Server](http://www.dell.com/us/business/p/poweredge-t320/fs). Times will change, but at the moment here is what to shoot for:

* 8 Cores
* 16 GB Ram
* RAID Controller

2. Install Operating System

Please see the section on Operating Systems for this. If you feel comfortable I recommend using Ubuntu Server. However, that does not include a graphical user interface. It is a best practice to not install software we don't need on a server computer.

Essentially what you will be doing is writing the install image to a usb. Some software for this would be:

* [Linux Live USB](http://www.linuxliveusb.com/)
* [Unetbootin](http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/)

For help installing Ubuntu Server, please see the [official documentation](https://help.ubuntu.com/)

3. Install Server Software (and create what you want)

Please see the [Bitnami Install guide](https://wiki.bitnami.com/Native_Installers_Quick_Start_Guide)

4. Buy Domain name

I recommend [NameCheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) to buy your domain name

5. Port Forward to Server

[Here is an article dealing with this](http://enterprise.sourceforge.net/configuring_routers_to_use_dynamic_dns_and_port_forwarding.htm)

This is assuming that your server sits behind your router. If this is not the case you can skip this step.

6. Set a Static or Dynamic IP address

This [article](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DynamicDNS) explains how to go about setting a Dynamic IP address on your server

Once you have this you need to log into NameCheap and tell it to talk to your Dynamic DNS client. For more information [see this knowledgebase](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/category.aspx/11/dynamic-dns)

## School computers (I3)
1. Determine what software you want all students to have

	You will need to think about what you want students to be able to do with their computers, and then establish a list of software that meets those requirements.

2. Recommend hardware to parents

	Not all computers are equal in power and usability. Recommending specific hardware to parents helps them decided what to purchase for their child.

3. Implement BYOD

	Here are some resources:

	* [One schools division implementation](http://www.peelschools.org/aboutus/21stcentury/byod/Pages/default.aspx)
	* [K-12 Blueprint](http://www.k12blueprint.ca/byod)
	* [Pros and Cons](http://www.securedgenetworks.com/strategy-blog/20-Pros-and-Cons-of-implementing-BYOD-in-schools)

## Support Staff

No new technology comes without a fight (and even existing technology requires maintenance). It is imperative that support staff be set up to help with the adoption and implementation of the various pieces of technology mentioned in this project. Please consult the Staff document in order to determine how many support staff you will need to hire. Having a general survey can help establish the numbers you will need.

## Community

Have a parent-teacher meeting where you establish clearly what form of technology is the preferred way to contact each other. This is important to make sure either party does not overstep their boundries as to where they can be contacted. Having a clear, established line of communication ensures that all parties know how to contact each other.
