# Different Types of Software

## Classes

When thinking about using software in general, it may be handy to abide by this class system. If possible, use only class 1 software. However, if the need should arise, class 2 software is acceptable. Class 3, 4, and 5 software represents risk to your future using their software (in that one day you may not be able to use your creation)

* Class 1 Software – is open source and produces media that can be accessed by OS programs.
* C2 Software – is not open source but produces media that can be accessed by OS programs.
* C3 Software – is not open source and does not produce media that can be accessed by OS programs.
* C4 Software – is not open source and does not provide media that can be accessed apart from the program itself

Accessed means that a program is able to read and write to the file.

## Difficulty

In addition to classes of software, some resources are easier to work with then others. In addition to sorting programs by their class, I will also sort programs by their difficulty

* Difficulty 1 Software - Easy to use by anyone without prior experience to the program.
* D2 Software - Moderately level of experience needed to use.
* D3 Software - High level of experience needed to use
* D4 Software - Extreme level of experience needed to use

All of these difficulty levels assume a basic working knowledge of computers.

* WIP: develop an introduction to computers course
