# Different Types of Software

## Classes

When thinking about using software in general, it may be handy to abide by this class system. If possible, use only class 1 software. However, if the need should arise, class 2 software is acceptable. Class 3, 4, and 5 software represents risk to your future using their software (in that one day you may not be able to use your creation)

* Class 1 Software – is open source and produces media that can be accessed by OS programs.
* C2 Software – is not open source but produces media that can be accessed by OS programs.
* C3 Software – is not open source and does not produce media that can be accessed by OS programs.
* C4 Software – is not open source and does not provide media that can be accessed apart from the program itself

Accessed means that a program is able to read and write to the file.

## Install Difficulty

In addition to classes of software, some resources are easier to install then others. In addition to sorting programs by their class, I will also sort programs by their difficulty to implement

* Install difficulty 1 Software - Easy to install by anyone without prior experience to the program.
* I2 Software - Moderately level of experience needed to install.
* I3 Software - High level of experience needed to install.
* I4 Software - Extreme level of experience needed to install.
* NI - Not Avaible to Install

All of these difficulty levels assume a basic working knowledge of computers.

## Use Difficulty

In addition to classes of software, some resources are easier to use then others. 

* Use difficulty 1 Software - Easy to use by anyone without prior experience to the program.
* U2 Software - Moderately level of experience needed to use.
* U3 Software - High level of experience needed to use.
* U4 Software - Extreme level of experience needed to use.
