Below are some hardward reccommendations

## Wacom (C1, I1, U1)

Wacom provides a solution where they provide a touch interface. One can then use whatever software they want on top of this product to deliver lessons. Addionally, Wacom produces low cost input devices, which means this is a more cost effective solution to providing math students with ways to digitally input their writing. Additionally, there are prebuild Wacom drivers built into Ubuntu, which makes this a very sensible solution.
