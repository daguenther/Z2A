# Hardware

Below are some hardware recommendations

## Wacom (C1, I1, U1)

Wacom provides a solution where they provide a touch interface. One can then use whatever software they want on top of this product to deliver lessons. Additionally, Wacom produces low cost input devices, which means this is a more cost effective solution to providing math students with ways to digitally input their writing. Additionally, there are prebuilt Wacom drivers built into Ubuntu, which makes this a very sensible solution.

## Dell (C2, I3, U2)

Dell laptops are some of the best in my opinion. While other hardware seems to struggle at times to run Linux, Dell hardware usually works quite well. I recommend this hardware as the schools choice for student and staff computers. Projectors can also be purchased here.

## Chromecast (C2, I1, U1)

Chromecast is a small HDMI devices that allows users to stream media wirelessly from devices with chrome on them. This is the ideal solution for wirelessly broadcasting screens from phones, tablets and computers. In an age where teachers are using different devices to teach, it is important that the technology is in place to broadcast each of those devices to a larger screen.
