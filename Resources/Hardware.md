# Hardware

Below are some hardward reccommendations

## Wacom (C1, I1, U1)

Wacom provides a solution where they provide a touch interface. One can then use whatever software they want on top of this product to deliver lessons. Addionally, Wacom produces low cost input devices, which means this is a more cost effective solution to providing math students with ways to digitally input their writing. Additionally, there are prebuild Wacom drivers built into Ubuntu, which makes this a very sensible solution.

## Dell (C2, I3, U2)

Dell laptops are some of the best in my opinion. While other hardware seems to struggle at times to run linux, Dell hardware usually works quite well. I reccomend this hardware as the schools choice for student and staff computers
