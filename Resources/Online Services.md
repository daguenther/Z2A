Google apps for education provides a comprehensive solution to managing classrooms, school email, file sharing, and document collaboration. This service is the best in terms of reliability and cost at the moment.

## Youtube (C2, NI, U1)

Youtube has become the standard in video sharing, and everything else doesn't even come close. It is extremely useful for sharing video related content with students, and well as using it as as service to record your own teaching. It also provides the ability to download your own videos if the need should arise.

## Google Calendar (C2, NI, U2)

Google Calendar is useful for sharing time specific events to a large audience. There is an ability to export your calendars for use in another application.

## Slides (C2, I4, U2)

Slides is one of the best presentation frameworks I've come across. It is a online tool, but it uses the backend of reveal.js (an open source project). With it, you can create online presentations, but also download them for offline use. A pro account allows more features, but the standard account is still useful
