# Different Classes of Software

When thinking about using software in general, it may be handy to abide by this class system. If possible, use only class 1 software. However, if the need should arise, class 2 software is acceptable. Class 3, 4, and 5 software represents risk to your future using their software (in that one day you may not be able to use your creation)

* Class 1 Software – is open source and produces media that can be accessed by OS programs.
* Class 2 Software – is not open source but produces media that can be accessed by OS programs.
* Class 3 Software – is not open source and does not produce media that can be accessed by OS programs.
* Class 4 Software – is not open source and does not provide media that can be accessed apart from the program itself

Accessed means that a program is able to read and write to the file.
