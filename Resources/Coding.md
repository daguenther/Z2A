# Coding

It is important for schools to offer programs for studnts to learn how to code. Coding is unique blend of both math and science, and could be used in conjunction with either.

## Atom (C1, I1, U2)

Atom is a code editor produced by Github. It has a modular desing, which allows for many different packages to be installed within the program. It has the feature to preview markdown as you type it, and export your markdown documents to pdf without ever touching the command line.

## Code Academy (C2, NI, U2)

Code Academy is one of the top educators for code. It offers many different courses, in different difficulty levels. While not able to be downloaded and installed offline, it's service at the moment is free. I would reccommend taking advantage of this current opportunity.

## Khan Academy (C2, NI, U2)

Khan Academy, in addtion to their many other videos, has a topic on coding. It provides a more integrated learning environment then Code Academy, and more direct instruction in the form of videos.
