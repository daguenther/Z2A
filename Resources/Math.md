## Green Globs (C3, I1, U1)

Green Globs is an interactive math game that teaches students line equations. It provides help for both learning the content, and practicing higher level equations in the form of games.

It is not free, but the cost is very cheap ($300 or under), for a permanent liscence across a school.

## Geogebra (C1, I1, U2)

Geogebra is a powerful graphing program, available both offline and across major operating systems. It boasts interactive features, and a large online material browser.

I would consider this a must for teaching geometry.

## Sage (C1, I3, U4)

Sage is a library of higher math software. It is complex and difficult for first time users, but it can compute incredibly complex equations. For students desiring to take a higher level math at university, this is a great tool to begin to be familar with.
