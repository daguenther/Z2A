## Bit Torrent Sync (C2, I1, U2)

Bit Torrent Sync provides an easy to use interface to sync documents betweeen computers without the need for a centralized server. If the internet ever did go down, this would be the tool to use. It is also ideal for situations of data security, and the movement of extremely large files. It is available for all operating systems, from IOS to Linux.

## Gitlab (C1, I4, U3)

Gitlab is an open source git hub for managing documents. It is incredibly useful for multiple people to work on the same document independently, and the merge changes into each other.

It work best when using flat file documents, such as commonmark or LaTex. Knowledge of Git is also required.

## Pydio (C1, I4, U1)

Pydio is more of a traditional approach to filesharing. This is a server controlled installing. As opposed to Gitlab, there is no revision control and merging with documents, but it does provide a lot of ease of use for those wishing to share folders and files across a large organization.
