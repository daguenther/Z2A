# Operating Systems

OS's provide the framework on which everything else is used

## Ubuntu Desktop (C1, I2, U1)

Ubuntu is an extremely friendly Linux distribution. It provides internet browsing, email, photo management, and an office suite right out of the box. In addition, Ubuntu comes with support from the community as well their host company, Canonical. This is a fairly large project, and multiple derivatives have emerged that are also worth exploring.

## Ubuntu Touch (C1, I4, U1)

Ubuntu Touch is geared at smartphones and tablets. It is a relatively new project, but in the next couple of years should see considerable improvements

## Fedora (C1, I2, U1)

Fedora is a project of Red Hat. It has a different package manager then Ubuntu, which means that you cannot install programs designed for Ubuntu on Red Hat. Nonetheless, many programs are offered for Fedora, and many programs can be compiled if the need should arise. In addition, Fedora offers both a server, and cloud option.

## Arch Linux (C1, I4, U3)

Arch Linux's philosophy is keeping it simple. It has extensible customization, and a large community. Of all the Linux distros, Arch provides one of the best resources for learning about some of the inner workings of computers.

I highly recommend this for students learning how operating systems work, but not as the default operating system for the school.
